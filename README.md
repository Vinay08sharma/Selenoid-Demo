# Selenoid Demo

Here I have tried to run sample selenium test inside a docker container with the help of Selenoid.

## Get Started

- Make sure you have docker installed, If not refer this link [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/]

- Should have a basic selenium test

- Let the dependencies get downloaded.

- You need to pull video container if you need the video recording [optional]
  ``` docker pull selenoid/video-recorder:latest-release ```

- Open your terminal or command prompt

- Navigate to the project home dir

- Run ``` docker compose up```

- On it is up & running

- Head to the browser & navigate to [http://localhost:8083]

- Selenoid UI will be visible.

- Finally, Just run your testcase & you will be able to visualize the same inside the Selenoid.
